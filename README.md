FEWD assignment 1
# In the beginning
About a decade ago, I began my journey into adulthood, uncertain of things to come. Although I went through trying times of not knowing if I would have enough, what kept me going was my determination to not settle and to learn as much as possible. As with many people, **procastination** would settle in at times which delayed my further development. Thankfully, I have learned ways on how to combat _**that**_ feeling. Some of the things that I do are :  

*Keep a to-do list for the day
*Remind myself that I should be doing something productive with my time
*Workout to keep my mind and body refreshed and up

# Looking Forward
Having mastered the ways that best suit me in dealing with procastination, I have allowed myself to make time to increase my knowledge in other parts of life. At times, _**it**_ tends to creep in, but does not stay for long. Finding techniques that best suit your lifestyle will definitely improve your learning capabilities. Some things I have acquired through this process:

1. Water Distribution Operator State Certified
2. Water Treatment Operator State Certified
3. HTML
4. CSS
